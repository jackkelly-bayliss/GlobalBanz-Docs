  guild!

# Welcome to the GlobalBanz Discord Bot documentation!

## What even is GlobalBanz?

GlobalBanz automatically bans people upon them joining your guild and sends them a DM with information regarding their ban. GlobalBanz only bans people that are known and have been reported for advertising, spamming, raiding, impersonating, doxxing and people that really don't deserve a Discord Account.

## Do you use your own Global Ban List?

Sadly not at the moment, we're using a third-party service that has a dedicated team managing reports and approving added users to ensure that the list is up-to-date and only members that are eligible are added. Go check them out! [https://discord.gg/RfUusa](https://discord.gg/RfUusa)

## How about if I want to check existing members for their Global Ban status?

Do not worry! You can use the `gb!check` command to check ALL existing members of your server to ensure your security is at it's finest!

{% hint style="danger" %}
The `gb!check` command will automatically ban anyone that is found on the Global Ban List. This will be changed in the near future.
{% endhint %}
