  guild!

# Welcome to the GlobalBanz Discord Bot documentation!

## What even is GlobalBanz?

GlobalBanz automatically bans people upon them joining your guild and sends them a DM with information regarding their ban. GlobalBanz only bans people that are known and have been reported for advertising, spamming, raiding, impersonating, doxxing and people that really don't deserve a Discord Account.

## How can I invite GlobalBanz to my server?

Anyone that has the 'Administrator' or 'Manage Server' permission can invite GlobalBanz to the server. If you have these permissions, what are you waiting for? [Invite him!](https://bot.discord.io/globalbanz)

## Do you use your own Global Ban List?

Sadly not at the moment, we're using a third-party service that has a dedicated team managing reports and approving added users to ensure that the list is up-to-date and only members that are eligible are added. Go check them out! [https://discord.gg/RfUusa](https://discord.gg/RfUusa)
